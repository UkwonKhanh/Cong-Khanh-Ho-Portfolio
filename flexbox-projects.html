            <p>In this project, I built a forum for students to ask questions related to given courses. The project primarily concentrates on server-side development, resulting in a usable user interface that will undergo updates in the future. Its server is developed with PHP and MySQL to create a forum that can store and retrieve more than 50 posts. Moreover, to fulfill the CRUD operations, an admin account is added to perform deletion of accounts and any posts, which is limited for users who can only delete their own posts. <span class="summary-text">In summary, simple but efficient.</span></p>

            <p>This project is a collaboration of four members on a case study where we are project managers and have to plan on a digital transformation for a well-known coffee brand. Their products are well-loved by locals and have a few branches across the UK. Therefore, they want to expand their popularity by transforming their presence on the Internet.

            <p>Simply script to manage users, meaning automate all the tasks of adding, deleting, and modifying users. It was created with Vim, on Bash shell, and tested in an Ubuntu environment. Completely reduce the time taken to type each command and argument needed. Just run the script and type the required input; the script is displayed as a menu for the user. Then enjoy the user management system. <span class="notice-text"><strong>However it is still a simple script, and not being tested accross different system.</strong></span></p>
